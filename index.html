      <h1>Welcome to Sky High Hub!</h1>
      <!-- <h2>Why We Want To Dive</h2> -->
      <p>This is a site I, Emmett Austin, have made to get the word out about our skydiving plans, and to invite as many people as posible to take a step away form their comfort zones and join us jumping out of a perfectly goo air plane! Sound fun? Keep reading. If your still on the fence, I have a survey you can take that might make you rethink.
        See the list of attendees at the bottom.
        The plan is to go the day after Angelicas wedding for those who can make it and if the weather provides. <a href="https://www.skydivecsc.com" target="_blank">CSC</a> is <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/fNGtpKv5kA56PTKp9" target="_blank">located</a> just south of Rochelle</p>
