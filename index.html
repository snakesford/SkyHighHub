    <h1>Welcome to SkyHighHub!</h1>
    <!-- <h2>Why We Want To Dive</h2> -->
    <p>This is a site I, Emmett Austin, have made to get the word out about skydiving, and to push as many people as possible out of their comfort zones and join us.
      See the list of attendees at the bottom.
      The plan is to go the day after Angelicas wedding for those who can make it and if the weather provides. <a href="https://www.skydivecsc.com">CSC</a> is <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/fNGtpKv5kA56PTKp9">located</a> just south of Rochelle</p>
